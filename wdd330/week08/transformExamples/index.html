    <h2>Transforms</h2>
    <p>
      I am going to show some examples of each type of transform. Please hover
      an object to see the change in action.
      <br />
      <b
        >**Transforms don’t work on inline elements. But that’s easy enough to
        fix. We’ll just add display: inline-block; to an element:</b
      >
    </p>

    <h3>Translation</h3>
    <p>
      Translation functions allow you to move elements left, right, up, or down.
    </p>
    <div class="example1"></div>

    <h3>Scaling</h3>
    <p>
      The scale(x,y) function scales an element by the defined factors
      horizontally then vertically.
    </p>
    <div class="example2"></div>
    <p>
      Note that you shouldn’t declare a new transform: because of the cascade, a
      second transform would override the first. To declare multiple
      transformations, provide a space-separated list of transform functions. We
      simply add our scale to the end of that space-separated list.
    </p>
    <div class="example3"></div>
    <p>
      It’s also worth remembering that scaling, like translation, has no impact
      on the document flow. This means that if you scale inline-block elements,
      text around it will fail to accommodate it with reflowing.
    </p>

    <h3>Rotation</h3>
    <p>
      The rotate() function rotates an element around the point of origin by a
      specified angle value. As with scale, by default the point of origin is
      the element’s center. Generally, angles are declared in degrees, with
      positive degrees moving clockwise and negative moving counterclockwis.
    </p>
    <div class="example4"></div>
    <div class="example5"></div>

    <h3>Skew</h3>
    <p>
      The skew(x,y) function specifies a skew along the x and y axes. As you’d
      expect, the x specifies the skew on the x axis, and the y specifies the
      skew on the y axis. If the second parameter is omitted, the skew will only
      occur on the x axis:
    </p>
    <div class="example6"></div>

    <h3>Changing of the Origin of the Transform</h3>
    <p>
      As we hinted at earlier, you can control the origin from which your
      transforms are applied. This is done using the transform-origin property.
      It has the same syntax as the background-position property, and defaults
      to the center of the object (so that scales and rotations will be around
      the center of the box by default).
    </p>
    <div class="example7"></div>

    <p>
      The order of transform functions does matter: if you rotate before
      translating, your translate direction will be on the rotated axis. See
      below examples to see the difference based on the order of transform
      functions.
    </p>
    <div class="example8"></div>
    <div class="example9"></div>

    <h3>Transition</h3>
    <p>
      Any property changing from one value to another for which you can find a
      valid midpoint can be transitioned. For example, in transitioning from a
      1px red border to a 15px blue border, we transition the color and width of
      the border. The midpoint of 1px and 15px is obvious (8px), so we know that
      is a transitionable property value. The midpoint between red and blue
      might not seem obvious, but the browser converts named colors to their
      numeric values, which have a midpoint. If the border-style were declared
      as changing from solid to dashed, that would not be a transitionable
      property as there is no midpoint between these key terms.

      <br /><br />
      It is important to include a pre-state and a post-state. For example, to
      transition from rectangular corners to rounded corners, set the original
      state to border-radius: 0;.

    </p>

    <h3>The transition-duration Property</h3>
    <p>
      200ms or .2s is generally considered the optimum time for a transition:
      anything slower will make the website seem slow, drawing generally
      unwanted attention to what was supposed to be a subtle effect. Anything
      faster may be too subtle.
    </p>

    <h3>The transition-timing-function Property</h3>
    <p>
      The most common timing functions include the key terms ease, linear,
      ease-in, ease-out, or ease-in-out. The default ease has a slow start, then
      it speeds up, and ends slowly. ease-in-out is similar to ease, but
      accelerates more sharply at the beginning. linear creates a transition
      that animates at a constant speed. ease-in creates a transition that is
      slow to start but gains speed, then stops abruptly. The opposite,
      ease-out, starts at full speed, then slows progressively as it reaches the
      conclusion of the transition.

      <br /><br />
      In addition to the predefined timing functions and developer-defined cubic
      Bézier function, you can divide the transition over equidistant steps.
      With the steps function, you define the number of steps and the direction
      of either start or end, where either the first step happens at the
      animation start, or the last step happens at the animation end
      respectively. For example, steps(5, start) would jump through the
      equidistant steps of 0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, and 80%, and steps(5, end) would
      jump throught the equidistant steps of 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100%.
    </p>

    <div class="ease-in">ease-in</div>
    <div class="ease-out">ease-out</div>
    <div class="ease-in-out">ease-in-out</div>

    <h3>Tip: Negative transition-delay</h3>
    <p>
      Interestingly, a negative time delay that’s less than the duration of the
      entire transition will cause it to start immediately, but it will start
      partway through the animation. For example, if you have a delay of -500ms
      on a 2s transition, the transition will start a quarter of the way
      through, and will last 1.5 seconds. On the way back, it will jump 75% of
      the way through the transition, and then transition back to the default
      state. This might be used to create some interesting effects, so it’s
      worth being aware of.
    </p>

    <div class="negative-delay">Negative Delay (-1s)</div>

    <h2>Animations</h2>
    <p>
      CSS animations, unlike transitions, allow you to control each step of an
      animation via keyframes.

    <h3>The Shorthand animation Property</h3>
    <p>
      Fortunately, there’s a shorthand for all of these animation properties,
      especially since we’re still including the -webkit- prefix. The animation
      property takes as its value a space-separated list of values for the
      longhand animation-name, animation-duration, animation-timing-function,
      animation-delay, animation-iteration-count, animation-direction,
      animation-fill-mode, and animation-play-state properties:
